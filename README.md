## 🌐 Overview
Accurate traffic forecasting over heterogeneous Web of Things data is a fundamental challenge that drives large‑scale applications such as **dynamic routing, adaptive signal control, and socio‑economic analysis**.  

While recent advances in spatio-temporal deep learning have improved predictive accuracy, most existing models rely on a **single temporal resolution** and a **single spatial scale**, thereby overlooking critical dynamics that emerge at coarser or finer levels.  

To address this gap, we propose **DMNet**, a **Dual-Stream Multi-Scale Framework** that simultaneously captures traffic dynamics across **multiple temporal granularities** and **multiple spatial scales** within a unified architecture.

## 🚀 Key Contributions
- **Multi-Scale Spatial Encoder**  
  - Automatically discovers scale-specific metagraphs.  
  - Integrates them via localized graph convolutions, state-space diffusion, and cross-scale attention.  
  - Produces coherent sensor-level representations.  

- **Multi-Granularity Temporal Mixer**  
  - Models fine- and coarse-resolution signals jointly.  
  - Ensures temporal coherence through bidirectional refinement.  

- **Spatio-Temporal Integrator**  
  - Explicitly models interactions between temporal and spatial hierarchies.  
  - Employs intra-domain enhancement, cross-domain bridging, and a unified prediction head.  

- **Performance**  
  - On **PEMS04** and **PEMS08**, DMNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to **5.08% MAPE reduction**.  
  - Ablation studies confirm that coupling multi-granularity temporal and multi-scale spatial views yields significant gains.

## 📈 Results

| Dataset | Metric | DMNet | Best Baseline | Improvement |
|---------|--------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| PEMS04  | MAPE   | **11.65** | 12.06 | 3.40% |
| PEMS08  | MAPE   | **8.96** | 9.44 | 5.08% |

## 🔬 Ablation Studies
- Removing **Multi-Granularity Temporal Mixer** → performance drops by ~7.0%.  
- Removing **Multi-Scale Spatial Encoder** → performance drops by ~2.7%.  
- Removing **Spatio-Temporal Integrator** → performance drops by ~0.7%.  

This confirms the necessity of **joint optimization** across both temporal and spatial hierarchies.
